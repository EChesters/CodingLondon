      <h2>Welcome to the UK's first Codecademy meetup</h2>
      <h3>We are in London!</h3>
      <p>Firstly using Codecademy courses we will provide a community and support in getting you through, offering more insight and the why of exercises. After you've completed a course online, join us for sessions on how to setup an environment and take your first steps for that project you're so eager to build!</p>

      <h3>Why learn code?</h3>
      <p>Coding and technology is not only becoming a big industry, it's everywhere. Ever fancied building an online photography portfolio, starting your own business or simply just creating a person website? Well a lot of ideas now begin with code. Why pay someone else to do it for you, when you can do it yourself.</p>
      <p>Whether you're in the tech industry or not, if you're eager to learn and curious about programming this is the place for you. It doesn't matter about your background, professionally or academically. If you want to learn, we want to teach you.</p>

    <div class="cell col span_8 central">
      <h3>Why teach?</h3>
      <p>Have you ever had that moment where someone looks so confused they're about to give up. And then when you give them the best explanation they've had in a long time, they get that a-ha moment! That smile, that spark in their eyes showing gratitude, clarity and sheer achievement makes it worth it.</p>
      <p>When you've mentored someone in the space of just 8 weeks, teaching them all they know and they're about to give up <em>their job</em> to start a company with the idea you've helped nurtured, it's golden.</p>
